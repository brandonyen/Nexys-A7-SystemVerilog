# CPE 487 Lab Guide for SystemVerilog

This GitHub repository has all the necessary starter files for labs 1-6, translated from VHDL to SystemVerilog. If you are unfamiliar with the syntax, a great resource to get started can be found here: https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse369/24sp/verilog/Verilog_Tutorial.pdf

# Notes

- This repository contains only the source files and not the actual full lab descriptions. Please refer to https://github.com/byett/dsd/tree/CPE487-Fall2024/Nexys-A7 for full lab info.

- When creating the project, make sure to set the target language and simulator language are both set to Verilog. There is no SystemVerilog option.

- When creating design sources, make sure to change the language from Verilog to SystemVerilog. The code provided will not work as a Verilog file.

- Design constraint files (.xdc) are the same for both VHDL and SystemVerilog versions of the labs.
